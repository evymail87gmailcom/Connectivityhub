In this project I am using MySql Connector 8.0.
Download MySql Workbench and you will get it as well. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

To configure in Visual Studio on Windows10:
In the topnav menu go to "Project->websocketserver-properties". 
In "Configuration" choose "Release" and in "Platform" choose "x64". 
Go to C/C++ General. 
In "Add Include Directories" insert the path to where the connector is and the boost folder. Example:
C:\Program Files\MySQL\Connector C++ 8.0\include\jdbc;C:\Users\Username\source\repos\boost_1_75_0

Go to "Linker->General" and in "Additional Library Directories" insert the path to where the "lib64\vs14" is. Example:
C:\Program Files\MySQL\Connector C++ 8.0\lib64\vs14

Go to "Linker->Input" and in "Additional Depevdencies" insert mysqlcppconn.lib.

Don't forget to execute.

If you get linker errors, your configuration might need to be different from mine. 
Check this guide to troubleshoot: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-cpp/8.0/en/connector-cpp-apps-windows-notes.html
